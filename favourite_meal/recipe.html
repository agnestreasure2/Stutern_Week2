  <h1>My favourite Meal is Okoho Soup</h1>

  <h3>About My Favorite Food</h3>
  <p>
    My fabvorite meal is <strong>Okoho Soup With either Semo or pounded yam.</strong> It is a soup made from the Okoho stick which is very slimy after preparation. <br>
     It is usually prepared with bush meat (such as grass-cutter, alligator and smoked meat etc.) and best served with pounded yam (aka Onihi). 
     It can also <br> be eaten with semolina, eba (made from garri) and yam flour.
  </p>
  <h5>Origin</h5>
  <p>
    Okoho is the main traditional food peculiar to the Idoma people of Benue State, Central Nigeria. It is made
    from the plant   Cissus populnea belonging <br> to the family Amplidaceae (Vitaceae).

    It is a soup made from the Okoho stick which is very  slimy after preparation. It is usually  prepared with bush meat <br>
     (such as grass-cutter, alligator and smoked meat etc.) and best served with 
    pounded yam (aka Onihi). It can also be eaten with 
     semolina, eba (made from garri) <br> and yam flour.  This soup is usually prepared without the use of oil. It is the most respected and demanded food in all Idoma events such as; traditional weddings, <br> burial ceremonies, birthdays and other festivities. Okoho soup is highly medicinal and also known for its ability to aid digestion. Other Nigerian tribes such as Ibos 
     <br> and Igalas also refer to it as Okoho,while the stick is known as Ajara or Orogbolo by the Yoruba tribes of northern and southern Nigeria. The Hausas usually call it 
     <br> Dafara.
    Okoho plant  is an herbaceous plant with a long stem that usually originates as a wild plant in most parts of the Savanah belt, especially the North-central area. <br> You can meet other names for this plant in the different regions. For example, Edumoga people can call it Olicho, Ibo and Igala people also call it Okoho, and Yoruba
    <br> people usually call it Orogbulo or Ajara.So, the soup is made of its stem, which looks greenish at the beginning of its growth.
    As time passes it starts getting whiter,  <br> and when it is ready for consumption the stem is entirely white. Okoho plant is accessible summer.  
    By
     the way, the Okoho plant is also extremely remedial and<br> can treat digestion problems. So, if you are experiencing an uncleared bowel, consumption of Okoho soup will solve your problem.
   <br><b> And now your soup is finally ready. You can serve it with pounded or fried yams. Enjoy your meal!</b>

  <h3>Steps To Prepare The Meal</h3>
  <ul>
    &nbsp;
    <li>Peel the white layer of okoho stem by scratching the body gently with a knife.</li>
    &nbsp;
    <li>Place your peeled okoho stem on the side of mortar and hit it gently with pestle to loosen it.</li>
    &nbsp;
    <li>Remove the layer in rope form and throw away the hard stick.</li>
    &nbsp;
    <li>Wrap into a bunch together like sponge and put in a bowl, add hot water and live for 10 minute to simmer.</li>
    &nbsp;
    <li>Check to find out if the water is lukewarm enough to put your hand into, if not too hot then put your <br> hand and begin to press and squeeze with your right hand inside the bowl while your left hand is holding it.</li>
    &nbsp;
    <li>Continue to squeeze until the water becomes thick and slippery (draw), set it aside.</li>
    &nbsp;
    <li>Parboil your bush meat, add some slice of onions, ground pepper, maggi seasoning and salt to taste, allow to boil.</li>
    &nbsp;
    <li>Pound your locust beans to become smooth and add,  also add your stock fish, dried fish allow to cook for like 15 minute.</li>
    &nbsp;
    <li>Grind/Blend your Egusi with Crayfish.</li>
    &nbsp;
    <li>Get a bowl, put the ground Egusi inside and add little hot water then begin to knead, if it is very strong add water again and <br> continue to knead until it begins to bring out oil.</li>
    &nbsp;
    <li>Cut and mold like balls, after molding it all, add to your pot on fire and allow to cook for some minute.</li>
    &nbsp;
    <li>:Use spoon to remove your meat and the molded Egusi from the pot while boiling and set aside.</li>
    &nbsp;
    <li>Remove the rope inside your Okoho paste, leaving the thick Okoho liquid then pour inside your boiling pot.</li>
    &nbsp;
    <li>Use your spoon or cooking broom to turn your soup, stir for 5 minute.</li>
    &nbsp;
    <li>At this point you can see that your okoho soup is almost done, put on low heat.</li>
    &nbsp;
    <li>Add your meat and molded Egusi, stir together for some minute and turn off the heat. Serve with  Pounded yam or any “Swallow” of <br> your choice. Okoho is so slippery that it needs some special skills to eat it.</li>
